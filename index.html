<p>Beatnik Box script for generating random Beatnik poetry.  I made this for an experimental video project back in 2003, when I was like 20 years old.  It was pretty much the first program I ever wrote.  In the end, the device that used it looked sort of like a 386 threw up in a fishtank.  See here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrquint15/550240120/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrquint15/550240120/</a></p>

<h1>how does it work?</h1>

<p>The Beatnik script is pretty damn simple.  It has a few dictionaries grouped by part of speech, all in text files in this case since I didn't know what a database was at the time, probably.  So to generate a poem it:</p>

<ol>
<li> Generates a random length (in words) for each line, and a line count</li>
<li> Generates a sentence by placing a random part of speech tag for the first word, then adding a part of speech that can follow it, and so on until the end of the sentence.</li>
<li> Loops through and places a random word for each part of speech tag that makes up the sentence</li>
<li> Prints out the poem</li>
</ol><h1>why are the poems actually kinda good?</h1>

<p>Turns out, if you write poems using the same words Allen Ginsberg used to write Howl, along with some other words from The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock, even a computer can sometimes write something pretty good.</p>

<p>You can try the poetry machine out at my website.  A new poem is generated each time you refresh: </p>

<h1>do you save the poems anywhere?</h1>

<p>Nope.  Isn't that sad?  They all just go away, unless you save them.  I do have a tumblr that generates a new one each day.  You can follow it here: </p>

<p><em>DISCLAIMER</em>: 
There are some questionable code comments in here, but I was 20 years
old at the time, so there's that.</p>
